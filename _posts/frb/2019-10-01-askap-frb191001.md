 We report the detection of a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), as part of the Commensal Real Time Fast Transient (CRAFT) survey science project. The burst, FRB 191001, was detected with a reported signal to noise ratio of 62 in the incoherent sum of 30 antennas.  The system was operating with a central frequency of 920.5 MHz, an observing bandwidth of 336 MHz, and time resolution of 1.7 ms.  

A preliminary localization using the multi-beam approach described in Bannister et al. (2017, ApJL, 841,12). The properties of the burst are as follows:

Quoted uncertainties are with 90% confidence.

The burst was detected at a Galactic latitude of -44.8 deg and a Galactic longitude of 343.8 deg.   Galactic dispersion measures in this direction is modelled to be 44.2 pc cm-3 (Cordes & Lazio, arXiv:0207156) and 31.2 pc cm-3 (Yao et al., 2017, ApJ, 835,29).
